# Introuction to my Portfolio.

As shown above,  these Repositories are designed to offer design solutions to real-world problems. All five of these components are interactive designs and have been made within the current guidelines for creating interactive components. In this portfolio,  you will be expecting Research behind Every component, evaluation of the guidelines,  planning and designing the prototypes,  coding,  a screencast of a walkthrough of how the component works,  and lastly feedback and reflection.

# LOADING PAGE


# Research

The first component that was made was the loading page,  to give a bit of background information of the loading page, it displays is used to Give people a type of feedback to let them know that the app is processing in the background. It's almost a way of ideally reducing mental waiting time. Designers would use progress bars,  loading indicators,  Spinners or pre-loaders. The creation of loading screens has been evolving for many years now. In 2007 most loading screens would be created on programs such as fireworks (2007),  flash(2008),  and other tools such as loading gif generators (2009). Now loading pages can be created in programs such as vscode which where you can install packages to build a loading bar, Using react, animation CSS3. In 1993, Nielsen Norman Justified the importance of having loading pages. He explained the three crucial reasons as to why This component has its advantages.  it reassures the user the system has not crashed but what is working on the customer's problem,  it approximately tells the use of how long the process will be,  and lastly it's something for the user to look at while they wait, it seems less painful for them. (Dziuba, 2019)

# Evaluation of Guidelines

The first component shows the logo spinning Around 360°,  there is also the name of the app. At the bottom, there is a loading text informing the user that this is a loading page. Following the guidelines of making a successful loading page is having good use of colour,  the type of animation is used to intrigue the waiter, and is consistent with your app. 
In the component,  there was animation included off the logo design Turning around 360° in  1 sec.  the guidelines expressed that the animation loading screen should take  between 1 second to 3 seconds.

# The colours 
- #79AFD7 is the background
- The logo and title: #1D438E, #E74343, #E7C343
- The Loading title: #1D438E.
- To help guide what would be the best colour scheme for the app,  the Official website that was used to understand What colours combine well together was the material design website.
- Lastly, the downloading screen is consistent with the other component included.  with the same theme of colours,  the same font Styles,  and the way it's been positioned.

# Planning and prototyping

The planning process began with drawing out sketches of ideas,  then moving forward to wireframing where Figma was used. This useful wireframe help visualises what is expected when it comes to making it into its interactive design. Downloading page interacts with the user by indicating with a spinner that behind the loading screen other compartments of the app is still processing so the customer must wait. Once signals finished the next step was to go to vs code and export logo and the titles.png from Figma. Also when it came to CSS Styles,  I implemented the colours that were used from Figma into to vs code react

# Reflection
 
Reflecting back to the component a does reach most of the guidelines and as it's been tested,  the person that was asked about how good the component was said that it did give them an indication of something is loading mainly because of the spinning animation.

# BUTTONS PAGE

# Research

Buttons,  one of the most useful interactive elements, Is a control that Directs a customer into another page. There are many different types of buttons that can be used in apps and websites. Such as CTA buttons, Which allows the user to press the button to take action,  text buttons Where there is no border or shape around it like Regular buttons, Dropdown buttons, and many more. Buttons are used to invite people in and take them to another world from the tip of their fingers. Many buttons can also have different types of motions/ that can be animated. This gives more of a  professional look and it makes the button come across as smooth. (Basic Types of Buttons in User Interfaces, 2019)

 # Evaluation of Guidelines

The second component shows a page where the user gets to sign in or log in.   The two buttons were options where the person who wanted to log in or sign up. The guidelines of making an effective button design Are the size of the button,  the button must be a decent size where it's easy for the customer to click on.  on the button should not be really small but should not also be very big as well.  according to Apple,  buttons like CTA should approximately be 44 x 44 pixels,  and with Microsoft, phones are recommended that button should be 34 x 26 pixels.  the colour of the buttons must be easily noticeable and there should be some use of secondary colours,  the shape of the buttons should be consistent with the layout of your app.  if your app has a lot of Square and sharp layouts, The button should match with that as well. The position of the button should be clear to navigate.
 
 
The colours that were used in the buttoned were: 
 #1D438E, #E74343, #E7C343
The Size of both were: 45px , 45 px.

The Movement of the button: Pushes inwards once it’s been touched, Outline of the buttons changes, also the inside of the button changes to the darker version of #1D438E which is #16336E1
The button’s position is in the centre underneath the information given as shown in the video. The buttons are next to each other giving it 5px spacing.


# Planning and prototyping

The process of planning and prototyping the buttons was similar to the first component where some samples of buttons I would look suitable with the app that has been designed. After research has been done to find out what are the effective guidelines to follow to create an exceptional button. It was time to next move on to Figma wireframing,  there were certain animals I had to learn in order to make sure the buttons were acceptable for the guidelines. Such as working on the size of the button, How much padding there should be in between the text and the button,  how would I transition the buttons to make it reactive and can easily give the user a response that it has been clicked on. It was crucial to also have the button have a grid over it so it was known how many pixels there were on each side of the button.

 # Reflection
 
It is very important to have a button that is portioned a certain way and gives off a message to a user that it has been clicked. The button that has been created in this second component does give off a message that it has been clicked on. Although there should be more improvements with it such as making it more modern. It doesn't seem modernised as well,  so it probably makes the whole app look simple.

# HAMBURGER NAVBAR PAGE

# Research

A hamburger menu is a button on websites and apps that opening up into a side menu or another Navigation bar. It was created in 1981 by a designer called Norm Cox,  it was made to show people it's an easy way to communicate with users where a button can contain a list of items. Over the years it has become very recognisable two others and has been known for being one of the most uncluttered and best-organised button icon from all interactive buttons. Many apps such as uber eats,  ASOS,  and JD Sports use this to keep their categories in one place so it doesn't confuse users. many creators can also experiment and animate with the way the hamburger menu opened up. (Romano, 2020)
 
 
 # Evaluation of Guidelines
 
When it comes to the guidelines of making hamburger icons, The navigation has to be clear, it has to be recognisable, The menus within the hamburger icons have to be spaced out and positioned well, It has to be simple yet styled will, it shouldn’t be complicated. It should be located appropriately so that someone's fingertips or fun can reach towards it. As the guidelines have been followed the navbar does provide the customer to have a direct Access, correctly,  it is clean,  the transition of the sideboard sliding out and it is quick and smooth and it is simply recognisable. Most hamburger icons must be responsive as well,  so when it comes to coding this navbar there needs to be responsive. Once we shrink It Down it should pop up with the hamburger icon and once the  icon shows up you are able to press it and see the same menus of the wand from the website  navbar
 
 # Planning and prototyping
 
When it came to prototyping and planning it was like the same with the other two components, I had to sketch out ideas of how I want my hand burger to look,  It took some time to understand how to make the Navbar reactive.  luckily understanding the way the component works and how to code it didn't take that long because I have experience with HTML, CSS, and javascript. The layout of making a responsive hamburger navbar is quite similar to react coding. Usually, for some hamburgers, there are only two or three colour schemes.  The hamburger icon was pure white, the navbar was the dark blue that has been used before. #1D438E, And when our customer wanted to hover over the menus the text will change to a grey colour which is #86878a.

 # Reflection
 
This component had to be the best and more experimental than the other components,  anyone can look at and know that there is a hamburger, It's very noticeable and once someone clicks on it there are no errors it just takes you straight to the options quickly.

# MODAL

# Research

The fourth component is a modal box notifying a user with a message. Medals are usually small boxes that pop up to tell you something quite important.  this is a way of the business behind apps from getting the customer to contact them by just clicking that one box. It’s not a box that continues to pop up once the customer closes it then NH the notification will not come back again due to not wanting the user feeling bombarded by the messages they received. Some apps use this such as  Uni days.  to alert students with new discount codes for example. This can be used as content marketing when it comes to digital marketing.  a lot of websites do this as well because it seems a bit less annoying while it's on a bigger screen.(COYIER, C. C.)

# Evaluation of Guidelines

The guidelines of making a successful modal box are that everything has to be in the centre.  most of the boxes do take up most of the screen and is right in the centre if the text is either on the side of the box then it would not look as appealing and it would look a bit pointless because of the amount of space that has been wasted. The metal boxes also have to have a position where it's fixed in the CSS stylesheet Especially if you're making a react mobile page or some can use position absolute. You should have the width of the box can be 600 pixels wide all the way up Cross, The box also needs to be responsive so when someone minimises the size of the actual webpage the words in the box should not be disappearing, there should be a button to scroll where it allows the customer to close the bottom once they viewed it either they can press the button or they can press outside of the box to get rid of it. 

 # Planning and prototyping
 
When it came to planning and prototyping The guidelines gave a good indication of what to do and what not to do , When it came to designing and coding the box model,  it was something new to learn.  there are a lot of functions to put in in in order for it to work smoothly.

 # Reflection

Looking back and reflecting on the modal box that was made,  the CSS stylesheet needs some improving. There also should have been an image to make it visually pleasing to the eyes.  However, the functions of the box work well,  when it was tested it did come up with a message informing the user something and also a close button When you can directly click it and it will close or you can click the outside of the box and it will just come off which is how a normal functioning modal box works.

# CARD COMPONENT

# Research 


The last component that will be Look at will be the card design systems. Anyone was showing on the page just to show it as an example of what a card would look like. The card component is a digital container where an image would be at the top of the box and at the bottom there would be information. This box is used to navigate you to another page and to know that is by looking at the information part and there would be a read more link so will link you to the next page. (React Card component - Material-UI, 2021)

# Evaluation of Guidelines


The guidelines of making an effective digital card for your website or your app the cards should a noun flexible layouts when multiple cards are used together in one site most of them do not have the same type of information so when it comes to positioning and displaying the cards on the CSS stylesheet' it should be flexible in order for all the cards to stay in one place. Needs to look similar to a physical card,  if it doesn't then it will confuse the user.Even though the cards are compiled all in one place they also need to be space so it's easy for the user's eyes. Also is crucial that it allows the customer to want to read more by asking them to learn more or to Readmore. 

- #1D438E for the background.
- The box is #ffffff
- Lastly, the text is black. 


 # Planning and prototyping
 
 
Planning and prototyping the cards was similar to how it was planned for the other components however with this one,  the measurements from Figma were taken and When it was time to move forward over to vscode,  those elements that were taken from Figma was put into the CSS stylesheet' for the cards. This is because  they're Figma measurements were followed by the guidelines,  so it would have been easier to transfer those measurements over to vs code

 # Reflection
 
 
Reflecting on the last component that was the card design systems, the colour schemes seemed fine but it probably needs a bit of improving due to the fact that there was no box-shadow around the outline of the box,  the read more link did not have a link,  and lastly, it probably needed to be modified.

# OVERALL REFLECTION



To give an overall reflection there are some parts where there has been a new understanding of how to react works. It Is very different from the l standard HTML and CSS. React is more of a functional way of creating interactive design straight away and it all compiles into one which is really good.  what went world person is that there is more knowledge of how it all works, Is probably an easier way of making an interactive design. The play has also been different types of resources that have benefited a lot in order to get these components functioning right.  the only issue is that there was a lack of Styles compared to the Figma work that has been done.  if there was a chance to go over the work again,  the first thing is to really dissect the meaning of reacting interactive designs and learning about how to style reactive component properly to the best standard.  and maybe do a bit more research as to what makes a really good website instead of being biased.
