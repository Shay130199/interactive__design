As shown above,  these Repositories Are designed to offer design solutions to real-world problems. All five of these designs are interactive designs and have been made within the current guidelines for creating interactive components. In this portfolio,  you will be expecting Research behind Every component, evaluation of the guidelines,  planning and designing the prototypes,  coding,  a screencast of a walkthrough of how the component works,  and lastly feedback and reflection.
